    What was your thought process for selecting criteria for personalized recommendations?

    I chose to have a weighted system using the "author", "category", and "page section" to determine what type of content the user is most likely to consume, then display it in the recommended section in descending order based on score provided by the weighted system

    If given more time, what improvements would you make to the feed page or your recommendations? (e.g. deduplication, SEO, etc)

    The dummie data doesn't have a standart payload, so i'll change that, as well i'll eliminate the duplicates between latest and trending to get better the UX, i think we can use SEO to positioned de page, and the page distribution could get better, and in order to the recommended post, i'll add a login reactions, and maybe comments options.
